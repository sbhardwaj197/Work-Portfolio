What's the problem non-MRMs and/or anti-MRMs have with gym and physical exercising?,161,ze0nzp,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ze0nzp/whats_the_problem_nonmrms_andor_antimrms_have/,80,"I don't get it. Lots of people-on TikTok, Reddit, and basic social media love to make fun of ""gym bros""(which sounds like n insult to me btw they use it). I don't get the hate. They say ""men substitute gym for therapy"". 

1) Therapy doesn't work for men, and anyways men benefit from male therapists who are much harder to find and work with.

2) Common therapy doesn't help men, as men are never encouraged to talk about their feelings, and sometimes are seen as abusers and perpetrators by their therapists.

3) Gym has proven benefits- more dopamine, more muscle, test, low body fat, and a long list of benefits. It can help a lot of people, no matter their day job.

They also portray gymgoers as always this roided-out giant- when it is much more likely to be a skinny guy/gal with above-average muscle. I see how they whine about gymgoers being obsessed with the gym, and I think it's just them taking care of their health and mind.

In conclusion, take care of your bodies, kings, and don't let anyone put you down for that. For the few women MRMs reading this, do go to the gym, and don't let anyone put you down for that by saying it's  ""unladylike"". The gym is important for everyone.",1670315826.0

Which Men's Rights events have been shut down by or demanded the approval of Feminists over the years?,36,ze8jww,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ze8jww/which_mens_rights_events_have_been_shut_down_by/,13,"I personally saw online a few events about Men's Rights where Feminists came either with megaphones to disrupt order or heckled the speakers when nothing innocuous was being said.

1. Does anyone have a record of such events? Who organized them and when? Where are they either described in articles or there's video footage of them?
2. Same for the events that Feminists have recommended about men's issues. I want to see both what they consider good work, and who recommended them.
3. Interesting would be also events which have been denied or told that they must have either a Feminist speaker or perspective.

When England beat Iran 6-2 during the Iranian anthem the male players did not sing. They were doing it in solidarity with the Iranian women.

Reason I mention is this: this whole thing is a massive boost for feminism. The message is basically Iran needs feminism. So things like this associate obviously good stuff (like liberating Iran's women) and feminism. When we then criticise it we look bad.

I support Iranian women's struggles. But I do not support feminism.

I’m active in r/SouthAsianMasculinity. I got flak for criticising feminism. I think because in India (i’m not Indian, I’m British but I look Indian so I’m active there) women’s state is quite bad. Apparently anyway. Could be feminist BS. Like with threat of rape and women seen as objects etc. 

So what to do here? This is a major issue. Solidarity with Iranian women but not solidarity to Iran needs feminism. No it does not.

All these movements have men saying Iran needs feminism. India needs feminism. And well meaning men from those countries say that. 

But as we know inevitably in time this well lead to what we have in the West right now. 

So us being anti-feminist makes it look as if we’re anti those who are pro women’s rights in Iran/India/Middle East etc. And that’s a bad look.",1670320112.0

Long time issues - need advice,5,ze85n2,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ze85n2/long_time_issues_need_advice/,7,"My wife and i have been together for almost 14 years. our relationship started out very unhealthy, both of us coming off divorces, me not wanting another committment.  But as things happen, we got pregnant so I decided i wanted get my crap together and start a family with her. Side note, i already had 2 children with my ex, she brought one child into the relationship. 
Things were good for awhile. I was super busy and stressed. Both of us working. I was going to college and working 2 side jobs to help support my family of 6. I knew i was too busy but i just needed to provide. 
To back up a bit, i lost my mom when i was 9. Grew up with alcoholic parents. Didnt realize how my moms death was affecting me. I felt a constant need to be wanted. To be desirable. Apparently a trauma response from childhood. I struggled with having inappropriate conversations with women. She would catch me and i would freak because i felt this need to have these connections. Id promise to stop but fall right back into it.
Changing jobs and taking a significant pay cut was the final straw. My huge stress and inappropriate conversations went too far. I ended up cheating with 3 different people over the course of 2 years. Nothing more than one time instances. I would see how far i could push things and id push too far. Instant regret each time. Disgusted with myself. After the 3rd time i vowed to get myself right. But i didnt know how.
On comes a woman from out of state who id chatted with for years. i tried to break off our conversations only to be drawn in again over and over. I finally got a new better paying job and i just wanted to do right by my family.  I told this LD woman no more. Im done.
She ""conveniently"" leaves her phone open to our message and falls asleep. Her husband sees it and flips out. Tracks my wife down. She loses her mind. In the coming weeks she finds out about the cheating. Gives me an ultimatum-get help or get out. This was in september 2017.
I was terrified to see a counselor. i didnt think they could help me. I agreed to go. Man. I just wish id done it 15 years earlier.
My counselor works through my issues with me for years.  It hurts so bad i start to understand my issues and my patterns. I try to hold on to one ""friendship"" i thought was genuine, one of the women i cheated with. She loses her mind again and drives to this womans house. Idk what happened there.
The whole time im in counseling shes lashing out at me.  Shes both physically and verbally abusive. I would like to note here that other than pushing her away when she was hitting me i never got physical with her. Not once in our relationship.
Fast forward to yesterday.  Bear in mind the whole time since 2017 shes lashed out at me. Sometimes its every few days, sometimes a month or two. But absolutely a pattern.  I have not cheated since 2017.
Yesterday i get a call from my dad. Hes 76.  Needs me to stop and fix something on his computer. Wife and i had discussed our evening earlier in the day and i knew i had time to do it. Decided id pick up our 4yo from daycare then go over. I call her when i get out of work. I mention my plans during our conversation. She is triggered i can tell. She says she will get the 4yo from daycare and starts asking who she is... i stay calm and explain what was needed and and that i would be home by 615.  She hangs up on me.
I go to my parents alone and fix the issue. I leave and text her that i will be home by 615. She responds that she wont. I get home and she refuses to come home with the kids. Tells me i need to leave the house. So i do. I go 10 minutes up the road to the gas station and get gas and food.  I sit in the parking lot to eat. She starts stalker calling me over 20 times. Im really upset with her so i dont answer. She then accuses me of going to someones house near the gas station. I have my snap map.purposely turned on so she can see where i am. She claims it shows me at someones house. i never went anywhere but the gas station. 
I end up going back home when she sends me a cryptic message about not being good enough for anyone and that i wont have to see her again.  She makes this statement frequently. I go home to be with the kids. Im needing to go pick up my oldest son from hockey. She wont let me take the kids along to go get him. She tells me she will be home. I leave to get him  as shes pulling in the drive. She goes on about me not caring. Truth is ive just had enough of it.

I slept on the couch. She hasnt spoken to me yet today.

So how do i fix this? Is it even possible? She refuses counseling and wont go on any type of antidepressant or antianxiety even though she knows shes experiencing both...
I own the mistakes ive made. Ive worked so hard to restore her trust but it just seems like its hopeless.
Kept hoping different situations would help it. Shes now a SAHM and apparently that didnt fix it either.

An honest look at what Jon Stewart actually said,41,zdarbi,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zdarbi/an_honest_look_at_what_jon_stewart_actually_said/,5,"There's a [highly upvoted post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zcmo6v/if_this_were_happening_to_men_thered_be_a_far/?ref=share&ref_source=link) right now on the sub suggesting that an episode of ""The Problem with Jon Stewart"" made an absurd claim about firearm deaths being higher for women than for men. It turns out that this narrative is false, and the episode was actually discussing domestic violence. Here's the full quote from the show to give the proper context:

> Do you think domestic violence, then, is not taken as seriously because the culture is sort of trained to not believe women or to dismiss women's concerns? Because it does seem like if this were happening to men there'd be a far greater outcry.

Pulling an out-of-context quote from this episode to suggest it deals with firearms deaths is a flat-out lie. It is unacceptable and should never be repeated on this sub or elsewhere, as it just makes the person saying it look bad. Especially when it isn't even needed to show how this particular episode still hates on men. When we consider the actual assertion being made in the full quote above, it is still just as dumb, because what it is basically saying is that no – or very few – men ever die because of domestic violence, which is just as dishonest. It's much worse though when you consider the wide reach and impact this program has, and the greater resources it should possess to properly research and present these statistics around DV.

Still, it is not surprising that the actual words and intent constitute a very extreme position, because it is unfortunately in line with feminism's claims that female DV against men should [always be treated](https://theconversation.com/domestic-violence-how-the-law-treats-women-who-kill-a-violent-partner-6983) as ""[self-defense](https://www.lawctopus.com/academike/right-to-kill-for-women-battered-woman-syndrome-and-law/)"" by default. Therefore, there is always some amount of ""he deserved to die"" sentiment that is pre-existing when a man is killed by a woman close to him (spouse, girlfriend, family relation, etc), which excludes men from ever being considered as victims of DV. This works both legally and socially to completely erase men and their suffering. Hence the dishonest claim being made in this episode that ""men don't suffer from DV"".

To try and present a more fair analysis, I did a quick search on the subject, and I found [a source](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/who-kills-whom-spouse-killings-exceptional-sex-ratio-spousal) stating that: ""for every 100 men who killed their wives in the United States during 1976-85, about 75 women killed their husbands"". From this data point, there is not that huge of a difference statistically between the two, which is easily enough to bring into question the claim that: ""If this were happening to men, there'd be a far greater outcry.""

I wanted to find more and data, but I found it difficult to do so, which is what leads to the next big issue regarding this subject.

What I found most interesting about my search results is how many actually suggested that a significantly greater number of men killed their wives, than wives killed husbands. This was in direct conflict with the few actual numbers I could find (most country's data web sites just listed homicides without breaking them down by sex, unfortunately), so I looked more closely into the few opposing claims and found a disturbing pattern. Here is a good example of this type of ""women are not as violent as men"" claim, pulled from an [encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/when-women-kill-their-partners) page:

> Women do not kill their intimate partners nearly as often as men do. The National Crime Victimization Surveys estimate that intimate partner homicide accounts for just 4% of murders of men but about one-third of the murders of women.

This, my dear readers, is the nasty statistical trick called ""hiding the denominator"", and it is absolutely loathsome to see it used. A rate of 33% immediately jumps out at the reader as much, much bigger than 4%, but not everyone is aware of how many more murdered men there are compared to women, unless you are as familiar as most of us are with the real world that men experience beyond the widespread false narrative of ""women are not safe"". If ten times as many men are murdered compared to women, then for every 1000 men murdered, only 100 women are murdered. And 4% of 1000 = 40 men murdered by wives, while 33% of 100 = 33 women murdered by husbands. The numbers 40 and 33 do not differ that much statistically speaking, yet activists still find a way to present this kind of unremarkable data as ""women most affected"".

Anyways, let's be honest and expose the lies that are actually being said, because there's no need to make anything up considering the steady stream of bullshit we get, with lunacy like: ""If men were victims, their problems would get solved instantly"" getting spouted without any rational thought. Yeah, right. It's actually the complete effing opposite.",1670256054.0

I never liked the idea of them but 2 years after tinder came out i let my friends talk me into it. I thought why not. I had 2 female friends that i hung out with often at the time. They seemed to be having a great time on it. Going on dates and such. I downloaded tinder and go in completely innocent. Fully reading profiles. Swiping right even on women that werent the best looking but that i wanted to give a chance to because why not, she might be a good girl right? What i got in return is two matches in a month (which was dissapointing, im a decent looking guy and have no problems meeting women IRL) both of which were literally the most boring converstions Ive ever had. Literally nothing i couldve said wouldve given those chats any life. So given that experience i gave up and deleted it.

Fast forward to now. I recently heard about bumble.  Where even after you match, women have to make the first move for the chat to activate. I thought ""this is more my style"" so i downloaded it. 

About an hour after downloading i got a match. Guess what she opened with? ""Hey"". I couldnt help but laugh but i didnt want to be a jerk so i just said hey back. We had a pretty interesting convo and i invited her to come watch the baseball game with me since i had an extra ticket. She said it was too early to come out. Fair enough. We had a good chat but after several red flags i stopped talking to her. 

I continued my bumble journey and noticed something very quickly. Every profile is the same. Same pictures (one drinking wine in a garden type setting, one hiking, one with a pet or animal etc), Same bios, Same responses to the ""more about me"" style questions, and as i started getting more matches (way more than tinder) they all open with the same lines that they hate men open up with. ""Hey, whats up, hows it going, hi hows your day."" I had a recent match that instantly started laying all of her problems on me how she didnt want to be pumped and dumped anymore, how she only wanted to meet up if i was serious about a future with someone (that one freaked me out so i stopped replying).

I just find all of this hilarious and so hypocritical. How they hate this type of behavior from men but then go on to do everything they say they hate and on top of it all expect us to accept it. What they dont realise is most men would love a relationship with someone we like but we would also rather be alone than with someone that stresses us out. Our peace comes first and fellas... keep it that way. We are not disposable utilities. We are human beings with needs and feelings. If youre dating, take care of yourself out there and be careful.",1670216213.0
observance of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Men and Boys,41,zd5moi,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zd5moi/observance_of_the_international_day_for_the/,1,"Everyone is welcome to be part of the 4th observance of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Men and Boys. It will be held on 31 January 2023.  This special Day is long overdue and is badly needed in our world. The trauma of violence has been with humanity for a long time. Unfortunately, Some persons accept  violence against men and boys as normal.

It is frightening that it is often difficult to distinguish among violence, punishment and discipline. Many boys are physically and emotionally abused in homes and schools. Parents and teachers often use violence to  create discipline.  Scientific knowledge has clearly demonstrated how the use of violence in parenting has no benefits at all, but only causes damage for the child.Many parents are ignorant or unaware of their role and responsibility, hence the reason for the intervention of Family Court judges and social workers to protect the child or children. Likewise, guards use violence as a form of punishment for incarcerated persons. This violence only creates temporary obedience and stability.

Violence is regularly used to empower, intimidate, control, and destroy.   It seems contradictory  that violence is often used to end violence or as an excuse for discipline. The boy who is whipped, beaten or bullied to be studious, disciplined, or well-mannered will most likely mature into a dysfunctional adult who will also commit violence because he sees it as normal and natural. And, unfortunately, it is these dysfunctional adults who are more prone to mental health issues.  In many countries there is an absence of data on the male victims of domestic abuse. Additionally, there is a glaring absence of safehouses or centres for male victims of sexual and physical abuse. Many men are forced to serve in the military whilst others face violence in their workplaces.On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Men and Boys let us highlight and create nonviolent spaces. Let us search for solutions to end all forms of violence against males.

People were kinda suspicious about it since the beginning knowing that they could make it by forcing men to being conscripted.

Now we can see some men being conscripted for 33 days of military training. The situation Got pretty viral and people are opposing the idea of conscription. Sadly no party besides the ""libertarianie"" which isnt in government has written anything against it",1670232366.0

Suicide is Not A Useful Political Tactic (Obviously),10,zd74ad,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zd74ad/suicide_is_not_a_useful_political_tactic_obviously/,6,"There was recently a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zcrg1b/a_principal_at_a_local_school_committed_suicide/) on here about a principal who committed suicide following a false accusation, resulting in jail time and loosing his job.

I have conflicting feelings about this. Obviously he felt trapped and wanted to escape while also using his suicide to raise awareness of this situation to keep it from ever happening again.

I know this is rater obvious, but suicide is not the solution to issues like this. Did he raise awareness? Probably. He also jumped in a very public place and apparently [someone was 10 feet](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKA/comments/zc3l9t/just_witness_a_suicide/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from where he landed so someone is now traumatized. I bet the wife and school now feel a bit guilty. Still, that wasn't worth loosing someone who could have actively helped to keep this from ever happening to anyone ever again. He could have done more to help while alive than he can in his death, and a lot of people are just going to be angry at him offing himself so publicly, and those people won't even consider why he did what he did.

And that's just from looking at this practically as a political tactic, more importantly, there are undoubtedly numerous people who just lost a friend or a loved one. Those two girls certainly didn't deserve this. I don't know the details of how bad his situation was, but I feel confident that it wasn't worse than the outcome that we now have.

Obviously we can't undo his decision, but how do we in the MRM proceed? He clearly intended for us to use his suicide to try to change things, to keep that from happening again. I don't think it would be grossly opportunistic of us to do just that. It could even be argued that we have a duty to not drop the ball and let his suicide go to waste. But at the same time, I don't want to encourage anyone else to do what he did. So to anyone reading this, you're more capable of helping the MRM alive than you are dead. At this point, we can only hope to make up some of the loss, we'll never exceed it.",1670247913.0

That out of the way some background information:

I live in a European country that has a very femenine society. you don't have a lot of alpha males and all the stereotypical masculine unwritten rules like in Egypt or something. 

I am very outspoken about my political opinions (Iam one of the only people that would consider themselves a conservative in my school) 

I Have a social studies class with a red coloured haired feminist (the hair colour is fake)

So that out of the way, 
It was a normal schoolday and I was in my social studies class and we where working on an assignment when this girl (from now on named as ""S"") out of nothing started talking about how woman since a week work for free. I tried to explain her that it was impossible and that in fact man have it worse in this country and she got angry and started screaming. My friend backed me up on the fact that woman can't work for free because we have a minimum wage and she got mad at him too. She decides to scream half crying and leaving the classroom. She picked up her bike and biked to home and missed 2 tests and blamed her absence markings on me being an asshole. S then decides to chat with me in a group app where she adds her mentally unstable boy friend that is 3 years older than me and in the military and a mutual friend. S then asks me to say sorry which I didn't do then she left me alone for a while. Me being the moron that I was thought it was a good idea to send some statistics about mens right issues instead of acknowledging those statistics she started quoting some BuzzFeed articles and other American stuff while I was using government domestic sources. Guess what she then decides to say that she doesn't owe me any explanation and then 10 minutes later comes with 25 bible paragraphs full of ""evidence"". I then said I did not want to read it and had better things to do and her military boyfriend told me why I was wrong. Mind you this guy is doing 4 levels of education under me. I then did send her in the group a video of Jordan Peterson and asked her that of she was interested in my perspective to watch the video which she did not do. Then she started being whiny and I blocked her on all social media and her boyfriend. What happened in the next 15 minutes I totally did not anticipate.

She started talking to her nephew which lives in the same place as I do and asked him to talk to me because I did not want to listen to the other side. (This is what she initially said) then she changed her story to "" I was angry sorry man"" whatever she did or did not say the conclusion was she gave this nephew 4 years older than me and apparently into some shady stuff my number, photos of my face taken without my consent during class time and the place where I life.

Long story short she said the rumour of me slapping her was something the friends of her nephew had imagined out of no where. But she did have het nephew a photo of a infection of her ear that I caused because I slapped her. 
In reality the infection was caused by her Earring something she has admitted to a mutual friend. 

It does not matter what is the truth or wat isn't the thing that happened next is literally sickening I got added into a group of 100 different men some of them pedo hunters some of them hooligans others where motorclub members or even leaders. those guy where threatening me and tracking me with where I lived and that they where gonna shoot me or in my place or at school. My village has a really small population so the tracking was quite easily done. They luckily did not find my adress only my school. I told them that I did not slap a girl and that it was all a misunderstanding. One guy that was the leader of the group and the highest educated wanted to give me a chance and asked for proof. I did send some screenshots and he said he wasn't gonna read 24 screenshots and that he didn't understand English (the BuzzFeed articles). Then I said that I knew two guys that where in the classroom when all of this did happen and where in the group app when the discussion happened. One of my friends is a local of the specific town and they trusted him and the other guy was non threatening to them. The leader of the group trusted us and did let me go after the convincing. 

S did say sorry but now is mad that I do not want to speak to her for bringing my life in danger. She finds her opinion so important that if somebody doesn't wanna listen she gets her nephew to shoot you with his gang. 

Tldr: Escaped being shot because of an argument with a feminist that lied when she lost an argument. Only saved because one of my friends was in the classroom with us and is a local of the town where it all happened.",1670196008.0

Why are all of you anti ALL feminizm?

Like feminism at its core is the fight for equal rights. Why are you against that?

And I know that there are people who are like ""kill all men"" and don't get me wrong I completely think these people should be cricised but why are you against all of them and not just the bad ones.

I also saw that there where a lot of posts about guys not having equal rights in some areas and I completely agree with the fact that we should fight these double standards but here we are coming back to the same problem

Personally I see both (normal) feminist and (normal) people who fight for the rights of men as the same group. They both try to fight for equal rights. So like why do you hate one part of the groop but not the other?

To sum up why do you hate all feminist even if most of them are just normal people fighting for equal rights?",1670271783.0
I asked if women are owed marriage.,84,zc9nsi,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zc9nsi/i_asked_if_women_are_owed_marriage/,38,"A few days ago, I asked if women are owed marriage:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z9jhd4/are\_women\_owed\_marriage/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z9jhd4/are_women_owed_marriage/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

After this, my account got suspended, and I could not respond to comments. So I would like to summarize comments here if the admin allows it.

The comments can be clubbed into the following categories:

**1.** **No, women are not owed marriage.**

**2. Women are owed marriage as much as men are owed sex.**

**3. Women are not owed marriage, but men must make their intentions clear in the beginning.**

Counter arguments: 

1. If women want to marry, they should be the ones making their intentions clear.
2. Women should also make it clear if they are not going to have sex with a guy they are texting/going out with
3. Women should make their intentions clear if they are only going on dates for free food.

**4. Women are not owed marriage, but if you do not marry her after dating, then you are leading her and are a bad guy.**

Counter arguments:

1. Can the same be said about women who go out on dates but won't have sex?
2. Can things not change with time?

**5. People date to find out of they'd like to marry each other, so it is normal not to marry after dating.**

All these arguments and counterarguments are summaries of the comments I saw on the thread, and I have not added my opinions here.

On a personal note, I agree with numbers 1,2 and 5. 

An important thing a user noticed was that the original post was about men who just got rid of abusive/crazy ex. Instead of getting support, these men were being criticized for wasting years of HER time.

When women get out of abusive relationships, they are praised, supported and celebrated. When men do it, they are accused of wasting HER time, and we have to discuss if men owe women marriage.

Jessica Jones Sexual Assault Double Standard,21,zci8xi,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zci8xi/jessica_jones_sexual_assault_double_standard/,2,"I just finished the first season of jessica jones. I liked it for the most part. I thought the characters were well written and I liked that marvel was portraying female characters as flawed and complete people rather than just immediately being better than all of the men. They aren't afraid to admit that jessica is a pretty big asshole and it makes her more likeable since we aren't expected to bow down and worship this woman.

By the end of the season, my thoughts are completely changed. 

(SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE FIRST SEASON OF JESSICA JONES):

There's a plotline where she has a romance with Luke Cage. He stops talking to her initially since she withheld the information that she killed his wife and once he learns, he's completely disgusted with her. Towards the end of the season, kilgrave controls Luke in order to lead Jessica towards him. At one point, he has Luke tell Jessica that he forgives her. It's later revealed that Luke was just under Kilgrave's control by Kilgrave. He even uses the exact words used by Luke in order to prove that Luke doesn't actually forgive her. At one point, Jessica is forced to shoot Luke in order to prevent him from killing her. She rushes to try to save him. While he's passed out in her apartment, she kisses him and lies down with him. Isn't this sexual assault? It seems really fucked that it's played as sweet or romantic when the show's central theme is around sexual assault. It's made clear that he doesn't actually forgive her and is unconscious while she kisses him. If a man did this in a show, people would lose their minds. It sucks too since Luke is such a good character and they did him so dirty. He deserves better than jessica",1670180461.0

Putting aside for one moment all questions as to whether jargon like ""Gynocentrism"" holds any more water than Woke terms like Structural Racism do, there could be a far more probable explanation for the state of stagnation this iteration of The MRM has found itself in, since it's 18 minutes of fame came to an abrupt end in '19......

Quote: ""But beyond all of that lurks a far greater moral issue – how much do we value human life? Do we accept that a human being’s life is worth more than a dog’s life? Do we, in fact, accept that the life of one human being has more moral worth than the continued existence of an entire species of dog? I do. Many others, alas, do not. This is the motor of so much animal-rights activism, of our pity for donkeys and of other forms of animal fetishisation in the modern era – the relativistic notion that human beings and animals are not that different; the creeping idea that it is ‘speciesist’ to suggest that people are more important than animals. Only in a world in which the value of humanity has been degraded, and in which beasts have madly been elevated to our moral equals, could we even be having a discussion about saving cats and dogs from the hellhole of Taliban-conquered Afghanistan

....We need to talk about our moral priorities, about the specialness of humankind in comparison with the flora and fauna that surround us. To my mind, every human life is almost immeasurably valuable, for the sentience and consciousness and promise that it embodies. One human life is worth a million animal lives. If saving just one Afghan person’s life might somehow have entailed condemning every dog in that country to destitution or death, I would not hesitate to do it. Until we rediscover what is different and important about humanity, we will be forced to inhabit the cesspit of moral relativism in which 150 cats and dogs tug at our heartstrings more than the cries of our desperate and scared human allies.""

Men only live 7 years less than women on average. They only receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do for the same crimes, with women significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted—gender disparities in sentencing being far larger than the racial disparities you always hear about. 

Women outnumber men in the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral levels of education, yet they still get preference in college admissions. They are hired into stem at a ratio of 2:1 against men with the same credentials. But we should never stop pretending like women are still being oppressed. It would be a shame if they ever lost their monopoly on victimhood.

Conditional on arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge observables, men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do. Women are also significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions, and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted. There are large unexplained gaps across the sentence distribution, and across a wide variety of specifications, subsamples, and estimation strategies. The data cannot disentangle all possible causes of these gaps, but they do suggest that certain factors (such as childcare and offense roles) are partial but not complete explanations, even combined.

Now let's see how over the centuries you'll find that one woman in your family tree that will have this idea of what a woman is supposed to be and if you don't fit in that limited edition of being a woman then your a disgrace and not living in the right way
The chances are very high if you're from Asia, especially India and Pakistan you guys can relate to what I am about to say 


So now when the times are changing you will find people acknowledging how a career is as important for a female as much as it is for a male. Where people are breaking the stupid life tree they grow up get a degree get married have kids die amazing change but even with this you'll find people who want to do that amazing they have the right to decide what they want to do with their life if a woman wants to have a kid before 25 then she is too young for that or she is wasting her life she is too weak or lazy >> 


If you think like that I want to ask you why, when asked they hide in the name of being a feminist that they want to give women their rights, isn't feminism all about giving women the same rights as men and letting them decide what they want to do with there life do you think you're doing something, you're changing something, No you are not your still doing the same thing having this limited edition of what women should be if she is getting married or having kids then she is either dumb and you'll start hating on her 

These people are still the same as the people they rant about you just change some stuff here and there and then call it being a feminist 


This is what feminism has caused you'll find a lot of women feeling guilty because they want to get married and have babies they'll think they are missing out on in life No you are not you just doing things differently loving a man or having a baby being a SAHM would not lessen your value please do the hell you want 


Even in the action of asking people to give women's their right some (SOME) women use it to thrash openly on people especially men's.

If you think telling someone to cover up is wrong then telling people not to cover up is wrong too  you tell them that it's their body and their right when they dont want a child dont you forget its still their body if they want a child

Best quote: ""I just wanna help men see logic and reason"" BAHAHAHAHA

Anyway i'm going to make it a goal to do exactly this (head to BRA) in a couple of years, can't go yet tho.

My take on why women are pissed about it is simple: they can't **control** men who have left (them) and can't access their money and wealth.

I've discovered that freedom is realized when I can't be controlled by guilt, shame, and fear. Notice that the feminist response always boils down to labelling and trying to bring down a man's SMV?

Here's the list of usual insults that I see on high repeat:

Poor

Incel

Pedo/white supremacist

Loser/hopeless/ugly/old/smelly etc

Rapist

And 'I don't want you anyway'.

(plus ""fattist"" but that's actually true. If i want to date a warpig there's plenty around.)

That's the top 6 behaviors that make me want to leave the west, and go to a location where my health, education, taxable income and hard work ethic will be valued by the place and people there.

Meanwhile there's a few ways to avoid western women that i'm aware of:

MGTOW - Voluntary celibacy. Or use sex workers in a planned way, not technically celibate. (Legal in many jurisdictions, just not the US. But then again when it was allowed in Wyoming, it resulted in women gaining voting rights there, well ahead of the rest. [link](https://www.themarysue.com/learn-about-how-prostitutes-settled-the-wild-west-on-adam-ruins-everything/))

Become a 'passport bro' Go to almost anywhere that doesn't have feminist theology.

Date women but stay in control - be fit, healthy and self employed. When you have a choice of many women, any one woman loses the ability to act shitty and expect you to stay around for it. Being game conscious - date a lot, read the 'classics' from 2003 and sharpen your skills. This is still risky and expensive, use caution.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I love women, I hate what feminism has done to them (see the linked video) and would like to explore other cultural options. How long will it be until single men aren't allowed to leave, or punished heavily if they do so? ",1670109262.0
"""mansplaining"" used in the wrong context to hide their ignorance",84,zbtea1,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zbtea1/mansplaining_used_in_the_wrong_context_to_hide/,21,"I've seen mansplaining on TV and other media, but never in person. In person I've only seen it used to keep from admitting ignorance. It's defined as ""the explanation of something by a man, typically to a woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing"". It's usually used as a way to claim they already knew something they just admitted not knowing.

Today I woke up to my wife using the drill to put together a TV stand we bought yesterday. We bought two of them and built one last night. She didn't want to use the drill to build the first because ""it will strip all the screws"" . So I turned the torque down on the drill so as not to strip the small screws (it was making the loud clicking noises for future reference). This morning she decided to build the second and was getting mad that she couldn't get it to stop making the noise (blamed me for messing up the drill), and even said she didn't know what I did to make it happen. I asked if she turned it all the way up, and she claimed she did. So when I showed her I was accused of mansplaining things to her. When in reality I just showed her how to do what she claimed wasn't possible a minute before. I wasn't condescending or patronizing, just asking if she knew it went farther (I had it on 1, and she turned it to 9).

This is the only way I've even seen it used in person. Someone claims something that's not true and you show them otherwise. Instead of just saying ""thanks I didn't know that"" , it's ""stop mansplaining to me, I knew that, it just didn't work for me when I did it"". I normally just let her break stuff, and ask for my help after, but today I had just woke up to that noise and hadn't fully woke up yet. 

The thing that bothers me is the lack of responsibility. Why is it so hard to just admit you didn't know, instead its always turned to someone else's issue. It never works for her, not because she didn't know, but because things just refuse to work when she tries them. I'm just supposed to accept I perform magic that refuses to work when she tries it. I'm never supposed to explain the magic, just fix it.

I'm curious if anyone else sees this the same way. In media it's typically used as a man explaining something a women already knew in a condescending manner, but never in reality. It's more of a way to get out of thanking someone for an explanation that you just said you didn't know or understand. Granted in my example the best thing I could've done is just fix it and walk away, but then it's something I'm constantly needing to do for her, and I think that's the goal.",1670108254.0

I lost custody of my child, my family was torn apart, my mental and psychological health was destroyed. For the last 11 months of jail I was isolated in administrative segregation in a cell by myself where I left once a week for recreation. 

The detective that arrested me admitted at my trial that he never did an investigation, he arrested me 30 days after questioning me. I was denied bond 11 times and I developed major health concerns. 

As to the girl who did this? Yeah, we hooked up, but, I didn’t know she was married. When her husband found out, she didn’t want to admit she was a whore so she said I “raped her”. My DNA was never found, there was NO evidence even supporting something occurred, there were no “reproductive injuries” no physical injuries, not even a bruise. 

At trial, I was found not guilty of one of my charges, the others were a hung jury. My attorney asked the judge to dismiss the rest of the charges because the statements based on her accusation were “inherently incredible and so manifestly false reasonable men ought not to believe it”… the judge agreed 10000% and dismissed my charges, I was released 12 hours later.

The US Draft lawsuit was very likely only political theater from day one,37,zbt3sc,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zbt3sc/the_us_draft_lawsuit_was_very_likely_only/,1,"Some people may not be aware of this fact, but a lawsuit to challenge the US draft as discriminatory against men has been tried once before in the US's long history. The first attempt was Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), and the ruling handed down then was that a male-only draft did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. Even those who are aware of it are likely not familiar with the specifics of the case, which are essential in understanding what is happening in the present. The lawsuit in the early 1980's had sought relief by way of abolishing the draft, or in the form of having women drafted to potentially serve in non-combat roles, but these options were refused by the court. And it's important to realize that *no politician in the 40 years that followed* took any action to draft women alongside men or abolish the male-only draft (including the years of 2008-2016...almost a full decade when Obama and a self-described feminist DNC had the power to make this change).

Now a very minor shift happened in the late 2010's, when a change was made allowing the US military to have females serve fully in combat roles, and soon after a suit was brought forward by the ACLU, with the argument that this ""combat role"" change voided the previous supreme court ruling. However, I contend that this ""combat role"" argument – and indeed the entire lawsuit – is fallacious on its face, and this is only political theater playing out. I say this because only a tiny section of the decision in 1981 included any mention of ""combat roles"" in forming the judgment, with the following excerpt:

> staffing noncombat positions with women during a mobilization would be positively detrimental to the important goal of military flexibility

So this one small change around combat is not anywhere near enough to overturn the 1981 ruling. Not even close.

Also, people should be aware that the ACLU – the ones driving and funding this case – have become a solely political entity, and no longer care about their original mission statement regarding defending civil liberties. Instead they are now a fundraising and lobbying group involved exclusively in divisive identity politics. So their motives in this case are immediately suspect. Indeed, many legal analysts initially didn't give the new lawsuit much of a chance of even reaching the Supreme Court, let alone winning there, given that the primary reason for upholding the constitutionality of the draft in 1981 had not changed. Consider the following excerpt from the judgment back in 1981:

> The testimony of executive and military officials before Congress showed that the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than ""equity.""

In other words, when it comes to military matters and national defense, Congress can ignore any laws about discrimination, and the Supreme Court legally can't do anything about it. This is made abundantly clear in many places within the 1981 decision, with none more damning than the following:

>in no area has the Court accorded Congress greater deference than in the area of national defense and military affairs.

The fact that the new lawsuit even reached the Supreme Court – when nothing significant had changed to affect the previous decision – was a mild surprise to many observers, but the absolute shocker was seeing the Court refuse to hear the case and throw it into the lap of Congress like they were playing a game of ""hot potato"". Even more baffling – if this was indeed a serious attempt at changing the law, which it likely was not – was the PR-filled non-legal text of the SC decision refusing the case, which was strangely written by Justice Sotomayor, and that pushed an obvious false narrative about the original decision, and read like a DNC fundraiser and ""female victim"" delusion, as opposed to an official Supreme Court legal decision. This kind of punting of a case is hardly ever done, although when you analyze it closely, it really is just a less direct way for the SC to restate the original 1981 ruling: ""On military matters, we defer to Congress."" (minus the identity politics of course).

The TL;DR of this is I think it is very likely that DNC supporters – from the ACLU to federal and SC judges – saw an opportunity with the military combat change to try and hang this case like an albatross around the necks of their political opponents, all without any cost or risk to their team, since there is no chance in hell of this passing. Given the fact that congress can legally discriminate when it comes to military affairs, there isn't jack squat that the Supreme Court can do about it. This was always just a disgusting attempt to get a few votes, and there is nothing more to see here. If I am right about the shameless motives of those who brought this case forward, and those who directed its path through the US courts, then the US male-only draft is here to stay for easily the next several decades. At least.",1670107498.0

The issue. A few weeks ago I jumped on the bandwagon and posted a silly sculpture picture on a sub that rhymes with punny. Everyone was posting silly sculptures from their area.

Fast forward maybe a week, I responded to a mens rights issue. 

No profanity or breaking rules in either post.

Shortly thereafter, I get a warning. I thought it was from the mens rights post. Nope. It was the purely innocuous ""punny"" post. I thought the warning was a joke and I responded in kind. I suggested their bot was broken and it should be fixed. 

The result? I got banned from ""punny"" and was warned I could be permanently banned from Reddit. 

Is there a connection? Is this what it's like to post on reddit in general? Did I do something to violate rules? After seeing so many examples of free speech on reddit, both good and bad, I can't imagine posting a pic of a local sculpture in my community would warrant harassment.

The parallels between the contemporary MRM and Environmentalism are striking, and elucidated sharply in the writings of dissidents within The Green Movement, similar to those expressed in the link above. Just a few parallels

Quote:  ""There is a paradox at the heart of contemporary American environ- mentalism. On the one hand, its organizations are generally larger, stronger, bet- ter funded, and more knowledgeable than ever before. Membership has grown in recent years; there are now more than eight million dues- paying members of the major national organi- zations—and many more in local and statewide organizations—compared to about two million in 1980. Moreover, polls consistently show very high levels of public support for environmen- tal protection, levels that would be the envy of many progressive movements.""

In a similar fashion, ""men's issues"" have, in a sense never enjoyed the sort of exposure that they enjoy today. While MRA organizations aren't necessarily larger and stronger than they were in the past, there definitely are more of them out there than was the case at the beginning of the 2010s, especially at the local and state level. Similarly, polls consistently show that public support for initiatives like shared parenting legislation, criminal justice reform, and restoring due process on university campuses  is high

&#x200B;

""And yet: environmentalists find themselves playing defense far more than offense, devot- ing time and resources to fighting proposals such as drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, rather than forging new responses to crises such as climate change. Indeed, noth- ing that these large and expert organizations accomplished during the Clinton-Gore years— to say nothing of the present Bush years—com- pares to such landmark victories as the Na- tional Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, which a much more inchoate movement won a generation ago.""

We here at The MRM have similarly been playing defense more than offense since this iteration of the movement began in the mid-10s. During the movement's heyday between '15 and '19, our activity was mostly confined to Triggering The Libs on social media, and issuing rebuttals to things like The Gillete Ad and Brie Larson's comments( [https://variety.com/video/brie-larson-crystal-lucy-awards-critics/](https://variety.com/video/brie-larson-crystal-lucy-awards-critics/) )via YouTube videos, rather than forging fresh responses to crises like under and unemployment in America, a phenomena which disproportionately affects men. The present MRM's achievements during The Trump years(an era which was ostensibly more friendly to MRA talking points) aren't remotely comparable to the legislative and social victories of a more inchoate movement during The 90s and The 2000s [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10183](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10183)  [https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-06-30-9102270767-story.html](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-06-30-9102270767-story.html)  [https://reason.com/1994/07/01/man-troubles/](https://reason.com/1994/07/01/man-troubles/)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d28usWdvmSg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d28usWdvmSg)  Robert Glover published his seminal book No More Nice Guy in '02  [https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20020509&slug=niceguy09](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20020509&slug=niceguy09) , and Marc Rudov published his book around the same time [https://www.amazon.com/Mans-No-Nonsense-Guide-Women-Succeed/dp/0974501719](https://www.amazon.com/Mans-No-Nonsense-Guide-Women-Succeed/dp/0974501719)

Starting in the early 2000s, public willingness to acknowledge that women were just as prone to murderous acts as we men are led to the creation of the series Snapped, which didn't portray any of these broads as anything but the criminals that they are. In '09, one of NPR's flagship programs-Talk Of The Nation-brought the terrific Ned Holstein on to discuss the fraud that is The Duluth Model [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106820029](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106820029) , and even Tyra Banks devoted an entire hour to female on male DV, in which the perpetrator wasn't given a free pass because she was female [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdC0a\_agt0E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdC0a_agt0E) By contrast, the present day MRM is largely seen as sideshow unto itself, more famous for it's association with non-troverseries like Gamer Gate and Comics Gate than anything else. Here in '22, Third Wave Feminism still exerts the stranglehold over the mainstream media that an earlier decade of feminism did during the late 70s-the late 90s, and there's no signs of this stranglehold loosening it's grip anytime soon

""The same polls that regularly show high levels of public support also reveal this support to be quite shallow. The environ- ment rarely rises to the upper levels of con- cern. This may help explain why, despite the gulf between George W. Bush’s and John Kerry’s policy proposals, environmental issues generated almost no attention during the presi- dential campaign.""

Not much of a rewrite required here. The polls also indicate that while public support for making shared parenting legislation the law of the land, criminal justice reform, and enforcing due process on campus are high, that support is also remarkably shallow, and rarely coming anywhere close to the Top 5 worries which are foremost in the minds of most Americans. This may account, at least in part, for the fact that neither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden said much about men's issues during the last election cycle, despite The MRM having enjoyed 18 minutes of fame during the mid-10s, during which time they were often blamed for Trump's victory by the mainstream media

For all of they hype around Cassie Jaye's documentary The Red Pill upon it's release, it was also largely a phenomena among self-proclaimed Anti-sJWs(the contemporary MRM is an outgrowth of this subculture, much in the same Environmentalism is an outgrown of The Counterculture of The 60s)and their followers. The general public still continues to view The MRM as little more than a gaggle of socially inept and neck bearded man-babies, who blame all of the disappointment sin their lives on women, feminism, The New World Order, The Lizard People, etc etc

Men are wallets and servants,396,zamvat,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zamvat/men_are_wallets_and_servants/,72,"I think I am ready to give up. Over a decade ago, I met a girl and we fell in love. We spent years where she was pretending to be interested in my religion, culture and friends. She said she wanted to convert and she agreed to raising our children in my faith. 
I proposed and we got engaged. During our engagement, none of her friends were their for her. None of her family members were there for her. Customarily she should go dress shopping with them and her mother should pay for it. They refused because her other sister got engaged too and they wanted to focus on her sister. I went with her dress shopping which is a taboo. I paid for the entire wedding as a fresh graduate, taught her to drive, helped her establish a credit history. Took her to job interviews in the middle of the workday. 
When she got a job as a teacher, I helped her with her work and stayed late in school with her. When we got married she lost interest in everything except work. She wanted nothing to do with the things we shared in the past. House work? I did it. Cooking . I did it half the time. I scheduled her doctor appointments which she refused to do and insisted to find one’s open in the evening after work which limited is to just  one doctor. She complained and said I did not put enough effort and should do better. She was messy, sloppy and dirty. Didn’t like to shower or brush her teeth, hated doing laundry and always left wet clothes in the washing machine for days. Left over food? She would take it to work and leave it to rot and bring the containers to me to clean. I drove her everywhere, paid for everything. Every time I tried to talk to her she repeated thing see hear from toxic feminists. She is strong independent self loving woman and will not submit to a man. If I push the she starts to cry and say i hurt her feelings, if I push the matter still she start to say she is scared and the she doesn’t love me and will leave me so I drop it. 

6 years after our marriage she confessed, she lied and she never wants kids. I felt outraged. I was not getting anything out of the marriage and I was doing it all and now no kids too. I did not get married to carry two people all the time. I said I wanted a divorce and I will give her all her rights but first I will move out. We sat down and agreed to the terms of separation. As soon as I left, she filed alone with an attorney accusing me of all sort of things that can get a man in trouble. No evidence. This was during COVID, so I got a major pay cut. I asked her to alleviate her demands during the divorce but she won’t have it. She filed motion after motion always accusing me of things. Most ridiculous of them all was saying I was not complying because I am refusing to give her all my passwords. $10k later in legal fees we discover that this was all because she lost the Netflix password, was too stubborn to ask me for it and did not feel obligated to start an independent account now which she will have to do in 5 months. The divorce drained all my money and it was finalized she was shocked when she realized I had no money left and now she had to give me some of hers. She accused me of fraud and went to the judge. We presented detailed evidence and the judge ordered her to comply. She refused. Judge threatened her with jail time in contempt. I ask judge to amend divorce to instead of giving me money, which we did. 

3 years later and every woman I met, wanted a man to use for money while she keeps her stuff, wanted to be pampered and offer nothing in a relationship, wanted fancy stuff all the time or to dictate what she wants on me all the time. When I refuse they go on the attack calling my cheap and not man enough. 
Talk about toxic feminism. On a couple of occasions I got to talk potentially getting married with their families. Turns out they want to take me to the cleaners by making ridiculous demands including writing undated checks in case I decide to divorce her. 
Not falling for that again! 3 years and everyone just wants to treat me like less than a person and just a wallet with no opinions. What is wrong with women and their families! I am done trying to be in a relationship.",1669989203.0

If I were male I wouldn't have the guts to say this in public because people would not understand the implications of the point I am trying to make.) Basically feminists speak about equality. Equality in what sense? If it's equality to Men that's just so very short sighted of a goal. It also only seen in an economic and societal fashion. Firstly, I don't believe in dual genders. There are more, it's a government problem. If someone is enough convinced they are LGBTQAIEFG.... whatever, then isn't that enough to let them live in piece. There are more genders than just the two biological genders. The list keeps getting extended. Secondly, even the name Feminist is misleading, it completely misses the point. We Humans should all be respected equally, what's the point of a bubble of matriarchy (cave people days) combusting into a bubble of patriarchy (current day) just for it to combust into a bubble of matriarchy again (imo Females have the most important functions or roles anyways for many reasons). Feminism I think better rather be about redefining the term Equality. Equality to what? Of course feminists will argue it is about rights for all. I am trying to keep my personal hatred to the Feminist movement portrayed around me -- the kind of whenever a woman is not the victim but the perpetrator they will be loyal not to equality but to women, to the ""nation"".

The woman IMMEDIATELY got up and went to go sit on another seat (which was next to a woman).

What really outraged me was the complete lack of shame that was displayed by her. She didn't even wait 1 or 2 minutes to make it look less obvious. Because in her mind, this behavior is ok because "" men aren't a marginalized group "" or some BS like that.

And this is something I see almost every time I take public transport. Young women refusing to sit next to old men.

Why is this behavior considered ok in society? I live in a very liberal city. Had this been an interracial situation (A black person who sat next to a white person), nobody would have dared even thinking about doing that. And if they had, it would have turned into a local news story. It's almost like.......people don't have an independent brain that is capable of forming new thoughts. They need to be mass programmed by the media/culture to know what is rude and what isn't.

I see the same thing happening whenever men on Reddit complain about being treated like creeps by women even though they haven't done anything. The standard response is: "" Well women live life with more risk than men so they're generally more watchful and paranoid. Don't take it seriously. "".

But if its a minority complaining about white people locking their car doors whenever he walks by........that's a legitimate issue. You could use the same reasoning there btw ("" People are just watchful of their cars "").

Whenever men complain about this kind of discrimination, we're told that we're in the wrong for even complaining about this.

when you look at history, women are always the (protected class)

there has always been domestic violence against males.

who created the culture of ""toxic masculinity"" ? 

the primary source of internalized misandry begins with established old men who have resources and power within a tribe. they are afraid of the competition. they are jealous of the younger boy. but also it was the mother who raised boys, it was the mothers who taught boys that they need to defend their female counterparts. it was the mothers who were the primary influencers of a boy's mind.

there is this thing feminists like to call ""internalized misogyny"". yet nobody seems to see the massive ""internalized misandry"" men have against eachother. the truth is, men hate men. men are scared of other men. men see other men as potential threats. men are jealous of eachother's success.

men betray other men for women. because they haven't been taught to be kinder to their own fellas. men especially older men with wealth and resources give preferential treatment to the younger girls. but are always tough on the young boy who is just starting out his career. can see this clearly in recent job market crisis. young girl is easily hired, young man has to go through 1000s of interviews. because he is seen as a threat by the society.",1670012461.0

Men and women are more or less equally reluctant to partner up with people possessing extensive sexual histories, and heterosexual women are far less likely than men to date partners with few-to-no experiences or same-sex experiences. 

For the most part, however, only men’s preferences in this regard are subject to social shaming and highly scrutinized, and that’s what we’re pushing back on. When women have preferences, they can and do express them freely, without scrutiny or harassment. When men have preferences, those preferences are deemed misogynistic by both men and women.

> We proposed that sexual promiscuity would negatively affect responses toward both gay and straight men, and tested the effects of sexual promiscuity along with femininity and masculinity—traits directly tied to gender role expectations… women report increased negativity toward sexually promiscuous gay men, mediated by concern for disease threats.

Women said 7.5 is the ideal number of partners – only 0.5 partners above their actual average. Men cited 7.6 as the ideal number of partners, which is 1.2 fewer than their own actual average… Our female respondents said they perceive the threshold for being too promiscuous is 15.2 partners, while men consider 14 the defining number when it comes to promiscuity.

I saw people on YouTube reacting to this article. Anyways I'm kind of shocked and disappointed that the director of notable action movies like the Terminator movies and the Aliens movies as well as many other memorable films, now thinks the hormone found in all men including himself is poisonous. Well fellow men, we're officially poisoned by our testosterone.

Honestly, I think this statement is Misandry or I'm going to call it Internalized Misandry. If Feminists can use the term Internalized Misogyny, I can coin the term Internalized Misandry if it hasn't been coined yet.

Men and women are more or less equally reluctant to partner up with people possessing extensive sexual histories, and heterosexual women are far less likely than men to date partners with few-to-no experiences or same-sex experiences. 

For the most part, however, only men’s preferences in this regard are subject to social shaming and highly scrutinized, and that’s what we’re pushing back on. When women have preferences, they can and do express them freely, without scrutiny or harassment. When men have preferences, those preferences are deemed misogynistic by both men and women.

What do you think of the movie Don't Worry Darling and it's congruency to Jordan Peterson's views?,0,zas2gn,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zas2gn/what_do_you_think_of_the_movie_dont_worry_darling/,18,"It is a thriller that was written and directed by Olivia Wilde. Olivia Wilde has said that she was inspired by Jordan Peterson when she wrote the movie. 

Spoilers:
The summation of the movie is that the main character Alice, is one of many wealthy housewives that live in an idealized 70s themed community called Victory. The women all have unlimited access to shopping, live in beautiful homes, they cook and clean, while the husbands go work on a top secret project. 

By the end of the movie Alice has discovered that her husband, Jack, has kidnapped her, wiped her memories, tied her to a bed and forced her into a VR simulation created by ""Frank"" who is a parallel to Jordan himself. He was indoctrinated into this VR community through youtube when he was a typical ""degenerate"" (couldn't find a job etc). He did it because he wanted to make his wife Alice happy who at the time was working long shifts as a doctor to cover their lost expenses. 

Is very obvious through the movie that Jack loves Alice and vice versa, Jack says that he did this to make Alice happy, but by the end of the movie Jack gives up and tries to kill Alice. Alice end up killing him in self-defense and escapes. You also find out that some of the housewives were aware that they were living in a simulation. Olivia Wilde's character Bunny, had chosen to live in the simulation because her children in real life had died, and in the simulation she could be with her children. 

The Jordan Peterson point that it seems to cover the most is this idea that women who work are unhappy, and that women and men should aim for a more traditional gender role. 

Do you think that Victory is an accurate portrayal of Jordan Peterson's idealized society? And what has Jordan Peterson said that delegitimizes the validity of the parallel?",1670002285.0
Am I treated like this because I’m the only man in the department?,319,z9dd1a,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z9dd1a/am_i_treated_like_this_because_im_the_only_man_in/,124,"I finished my Master’s of Engineering at age 23. I’ve been in my industry for 4 and a half years, and boy does it suck. I make around 100k salary with a 10% bonus now, and just finished paying off all my student and car loans by essentially not having a life for the last 4 and a half years and putting every penny towards that. 

Anyways, this is my second job with the same company. I worked my first job for 3 years, and was promoted once during that time period (went from 58k to 78k salary). After I was promoted, my twat of a manager expected me to work 50-60 hour weeks on a routine basis to get all my work done on time, and I couldn’t do it anymore. I started applying for other internal roles. 

Got a new job (current role) within a month of applying and started making 90k. Got a 7% raise after that, and now I’m back in the same position I was at my old job where my boss expects me to be the workhorse for the department and work 50-60 hard hours each week. This week I’ve nearly had a breakdown every day, and I just can’t do it anymore. Meanwhile, everyone else in the department is doing alright, but they have no problem with me shouldering most of the challenging work. This is where I’ll note that I’m the only man in a department of 11 women. Seems like too much of a coincidence that I’m always the one carrying the load…

I don’t even care that I make decent money anymore. I hate that my job always ends up becoming my life because “this is our new normal” for our company in our industry. And our company is one of the best, too. I wish I could quit and just take a year off to clear my head and find a new direction in my life. I have friends in other similar companies who’ve experienced similar issues.

Not to mention, both of my bosses had absolutely zero compassion for me, or perspective on how overloaded I was/am all the time (and they were both women)x They just keep piling it on until I inevitably find a new job, which will be happening soon again. This is how corporations work: they suck as much as they can out of you until you burn out and want to kill yourself, then they hire the next schmuck and repeat the process. It’s pure evil. 

TLDR; 2 soul sucking jobs over the last 4.5 years makes me want to change careers, or just quit working altogether. I have a feeling it’s because I’m a white man who’s viewed as subhuman.",1669866524.0

Child Custody/Pre-k schedule barrier,6,za33lc,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/za33lc/child_custodyprek_schedule_barrier/,4,"I have been part of my step son’s life since he was 6 months old. His mother and my husband were casually hooking up when she got pregnant (one of those “I swear I’m on birth control” type things). Turns out she was trying to get pregnant by any of the guys she was sleeping with to get child support… surprise surprise we now see a pattern of behavior with three children from three fathers. 

Her focus is always two things- minimize time with dad as much as possible and get money. 

Her recent tactic after our new custody order didn’t go her way (we got more time and she has a schedule that doesn’t put all of the power in her court… but we literally are going off of her work schedule to get more time… and my husband changed. Careers to get more flexibility w his schedule for this) is to enroll in pre-k at age 4… just 10 months after we got more time with him. 

We live 70 miles/1.5 hours away. This would result in the current non-standard possession schedule that revolves around her entire nurse work schedule we accommodated to get more time to change to much less time of Thursday pm-Monday am possession every other weekend… and it would force my poor step son to have to wake up at 5am to get him to school on time at age 4… that is assuming that pre-k can legally count as “school or secondary school.” 

Is there a way to fight this in Texas? Can she really do that and can we request that pre-k wait until age 5? Or are we obligated to adhere to this at all until kindergarten?",1669935709.0

Mother-daughter relationship,27,z98kw4,antifeminists,https://www.reddit.com/r/antifeminists/comments/z98kw4/motherdaughter_relationship/,11,"My wife’s mother passed away recently from cancer. She was diagnosed and two weeks later she was gone. My wife has not been dealing with it well. The biggest regret she has now that she thinks about a lot and makes her cry every single day is all the opportunities she missed out on doing girly stuff with her mother when she was alive. Although my mother in law raised her daughter to be an ardent feminist and atheist, she herself lived a pretty traditional life. Her husband was in the military, he was the breadwinner, she did everything around the house, stayed home, raised the kids although she was college educated. The way she was demanding of her husband to provide and do manly things around the house wouldn’t give you the impression that she was a feminist and a non-believer in gender roles. The story I was told is that when her husband wanted to date her, she told him no I won’t date you until you get a job after he has just come back from serving in Vietnam. 

She raised her children on feminist ideals. She had two boys and one girl (my wife). My wife tells me she was so focused on her growing up, she was pushing her to do well in school which resulted in her getting into an Ivy League school, being a student athlete, graduating them going into law school in an Ivy League school too. She worked & prosecuted big cases and was always on the go. After a few years, my wife realized this professional life was not fulfilling so she left her job, came back home and went to school to be a teacher. She wanted a “simple life”. The irony of this is that the mother was not pushy at all with the boys, she just assumed they will come out strong on their own but they didn’t. The youngest is one of the weakest men I have probably met in my life, he couldn’t even be in the room with his dying mother for more than 2 minutes. 

I see it as a very sad but perfect example of what’s deeply wrong with modern feminism. A mother who was herself living & enjoying traditional life pushed her daughter to pursue a career she never even wanted but never expected much from her boys. My wife now tells me that family life is all that brings her any joy in life and not one day goes without her remembering the texts she used to get from her mother asking what color of nail polish she should choose and how to style her hair and how angry she’d get at how frivolous those texts were to her because she was busy working in the court room or gathering evidence…etc and she’d throw away the phone thinking “I’m in front of a judge now and she’s asking me about nail polish”. These situations brought a lot of stress to their relationship as her mom always blamed her for not giving her enough attention and time and they often fought. 

My wife wished she had another chance to go do her nails with her mom and go get lunch afterwards then go to the mall & shop. She’d give anything to do that with her again but she’s gone. She says she had to learn how to be feminine because she never was growing up. 

Children is a very sore subject for my wife. She actually believes that feminism leads women towards an unhappy & an unfulfilling life. She can’t have children because she waited to get married till after 40 and now she regrets succumbing to her mom pressures about being a successful lawyer & the typical “independent strong woman” because she didn’t realize that it cost her the ability to have children until it was too late. Living with these regrets is not easy on her mental health. She tells me how much she hates seeing our neighbors going out with their children and her co workers speaking to her about them. She feels an emptiness that she can do nothing about. We often hang out with a younger couple who are our neighbors. They have a 2 year old son and she adores him, showers him with affection, attention & gifts. I see the pain in her eyes when we have to leave and I feel helpless.

Even my father in law is noticeably enjoying life more now after his wife’s passing. I found it deeply disrespectful and ironic that during family dinners they would discuss his death and his burial often and never hers. It just made me feel like he was disposable to them. The ironic part is that she was the one who passed away first. In the hospital, she would tell them how she always thought he would go first. My understanding is that because of the influence of feminist ideas, she was bossy at home and not as loving & nurturing. My wife is struggling with the idea that her dad bought a new car a week after her passing and he’s going on a road trip and that he speaks with a sense of determination about decisions around the house and how they will celebrate certain holidays because it was often the mom who used to decide on all of that and the father was left aside. My wife found that hard to swallow. She grew up seeing her mom pretty much have the final say in all major stuff. The fact that he is noticeably decisive about these issues tells us that he never enjoyed put to the side like that by his late wife. I have been trying my best to help my wife pay attention to how much she disregards her father and outright disrespect him right in front of me. I always voice my displeasure as to the way she speaks about him sometimes with me and we argue about it. She blames me for taking her brother’s and father’s side often instead of her side only to later on come back and tell me that by helping curb her emotional outbursts with her father and brother, I’m helping her become a better person and I’m glad she is able to see another perspective from a man in her life different than her father or brothers or bosses/coworkers.

Feminist ideas basically destroyed this otherwise wonderful relationship between a mother and her daughter and helped raise two weak men who couldn’t even be with their mother in her dying moments as well as an unhappy, unfulfilled, infertile woman.",1669854501.0
Kim Kardashin to receive 200k/month child support (aka cash and prizes)… Men this is a red siren warning.,992,z8l6a3,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z8l6a3/kim_kardashin_to_receive_200kmonth_child_support/,212,,1669794036.0
Women and conformity: progress and change,4,z9n0wk,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z9n0wk/women_and_conformity_progress_and_change/,21,"Obviously, I don't want to generalise. Humans in general follow the crowd, keep their heads down, don't want to make noise, but a few articles I've read got me thinking: they were basically saying in most western democracies, women historically voted more for the more relatively conservative or right wing party, but this has been changing in the last few decades/years and often reversing. The trend wasn't as strong in the US, but voting didn't become gendered until really after Reagan. Young people and people in urban areas in general, but it's strongest among young women. Anyway, one article spoke about how more American women are identify as liberal compared to men, especially young women. The main reason cited was Democrats in general claim to fight more for women's issues, especially abortion. I know this is not exclusive to women of course, but it really seems women are more prone to following the peers and status quo, whatever that is. In the past feminists were a minority of vocal women, many women were either content to keep things or unable or unwilling to change things. Despite being oppressed, they tended to vote for more conservative parties. Granted maybe the parties didn't differ a lot on issues, but it's interesting you only see women turn sharply to the 'left' when it becomes mainstream. It seems fewer women question norms, whereas more men do, relatively. They're more pressured to believe certain things. You could argue there are evolutionary-socio-biological reasons for women being more group-oriented. This also plays out in mate attractiveness and selection. I think more women than men also embrace a more collectivist mindset, which I think has pros and cons. I don't think theyre innately more liberal or open minded (I dont think either gender is actually), and the difference in conformity might not be that large (also many people who identify as moderate or even conservative do have many views on social issues that wouldve been considered liberal not long ago).

"Toxic Feminism: Feminist magazine Jezebel calls disciplinary action against vigilante female student ""unfair treatment""",87,z8xezv,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z8xezv/toxic_feminism_feminist_magazine_jezebel_calls/,13,"Documented at r/ToxicFeminismIsToxic.

A feminist author Kylie Cheung wore an article in feminist magazine Jezebel (sources in [https://np.reddit.com/r/ToxicFeminismIsToxic/comments/z8w4lp/feminist\_magazine\_jezebel\_calls\_disciplinary/](https://np.reddit.com/r/ToxicFeminismIsToxic/comments/z8w4lp/feminist_magazine_jezebel_calls_disciplinary/)) describing a tragic story of a young student Katie Meyer who took her life ""almost immediately after she received notice"" that she faced a hearing and potential disciplinary action.

Meyer faced disciplinary action for retaliating against another student, a football player, who **allegedly** raped her underage teammate. In this retaliation she spilled coffee on the football player - which according to a complaint received by the university, resulted in physical injury.

There is no additional information about the rape case in the article itself, other than the rape was alleged. The parents of Katie Meyer are suing the university, because why not, and the university protests that Meyer was offered ""an advisor to work with her throughout the process and told her she could have a support person of her choosing with her in any meeting or conversation with OCS.” Which I suppose is one adviser and one support person more that was offered to the accused football player. 

Grieving parents aside, their legal team suing the university is already attacking whatever is left of the right to a due process under Title IX and basic safety of those who are accused: “Through this litigation we will not only obtain justice for Katie, but also ensure necessary change is put into place to help protect Stanford students and provide safeguards when students are in need of support,” meaning they want more protection for vigilantes, not their victims. 

The feminist magazine doubles down on the feminist anti-due process rhetoric writing: ""The **unfair treatment** Meyer faced is the latest in the university’s history of appearing to protect assailants at the expense of rape victims.""

**PS**: It is the anti-due process movement, not the disturbed young student who is the problem here. Respect the tragedy and be civil.",1669829369.0
Feminism has always been a man hating female supremacist group that wants supremacy and control over men. They have never wanted equality. They used the word equality to fool people into getting what they want.,119,z8ppgu,antifeminists,https://www.reddit.com/r/antifeminists/comments/z8ppgu/feminism_has_always_been_a_man_hating_female/,23,"""Feminism used to be about equality. It used to be good. It turned bad in the 3rd wave. It also used to fight for men too"" Wrong. Feminism was never about equality. It was always bad and they have always ever talk about women's right and protest to get them. They only talk about men's right and talk about fighting for it to fool guys into becoming expendable tools for them. Also, the phrases good,true,real,factual feminists and good,true,real feminism are oxymoronic. Anyone that call themselves a feminist is an idiot.

In WW1, prominent feminists and suffragettes of the time, such as Emmeline Pankhurst, the leader of the British suffragette movement who helped women win the right to vote and her daughter Christabel, co-founder of the Women's Social and Political Union joined the Order of the White Feather, an organization aimed to shame men into enlisting in the British army by persuading women to present them with a white feather if they were not wearing a uniform. They, in addition to handing out the feathers, also lobbied to institute an involuntary universal draft, which included those who lacked votes due to being too young or not owning property.

Several hateful and misandrist quotes from political and famous feminists, 2nd and 3rd waves, for example:

""The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race."" — Sally Miller Gearhart, in The Future - If There Is One - Is Female.

""To call a man an animal is to flatter him; he’s a machine, a walking dildo."" _Valerie Solanas, Authoress of the SCUM Manifesto

A)1st wave: Lois Waisbrooker was an American feminist author, editor, publisher, and campaigner of the later nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. She is best remembered for her 1893 novel A Sex Revolution in which she advocated mass genocide of men to reduce them to 10 percent of the human population.

B)2nd wave: Sally Miller Gearhart, an American teacher, feminist, science-fiction writer, and political activist. In 1973, she became the first open lesbian to obtain a tenure-track faculty position when she was hired by San Francisco State University, where she helped establish one of the first women and gender study programs in the country. She said: ''The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race.'' and ''At least three further requirements supplement the strategies of environmentalists if we were to create and preserve a less violent world. 1) Every culture must begin to affirm the female future. 2) Species responsibility must be returned to women in every culture. 3) The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately ten percent of the human race.''

2nd wave: Valerie Solanas, the feminist author of the SCUM manifesto, shot and almost murdered popular artist Andy Warhol. And when did , Ti-Grace Atkinson, then the president of NOW, rallied to Solanas and enlisted prominent civil rights attorney Flo Kennedy to handle her defense.

2nd wave: The SCUM manifesto, a radical feminist manifesto by Valerie Solanas which suggests the formation of SCUM, an organization dedicated to overthrowing society and eliminating the male sex. This manifesto is actually still taught in some gender studies classes and is still considered a notorious and influential feminist text. Feminists claim it is a ""satirical"" work (""ironic misandry'') even though In 1968, when speaking to Marmorstein, Valerie characterized herself on the ""'SCUM thing'"" as dead serious. 

E) Moreover, Solanas' notion that males are ""genetically inferior"" was echoed by celebrated mainstream feminists during the first and second waves: 1) Elizabeth Cady Stanton was an American suffragist, social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women's rights movement. She was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association from 1892 until 1900. Elizabeth Staton said ""we are, as a sex, infinitely superior to men, and if we were free and developed, healthy in body and mind, as we should be under natural conditions, our motherhood would be our glory. That function gives women such wisdom and power as no male can possess.'' 2)Germaine Greer is an Australian writer and public intellectual, regarded as one of the major voices of the second-wave feminist movement in the latter half of the 20th century. She said :'' I think that testosterone is a rare poison''

1st wave feminists: Two examples of first wave feminists demanding and getting men's rights without men's responsibilities. Two of them actively involve zero sum situations such as income and property rights, or custody rights to children, and in both cases feminists managed to arrange things such that women got all the rights while men were still burdened with all the responsibility: 

1)Won the right for married women to own their own property and income, and hold it separate from their husband's control. Yet maintained the legal entitlement of married women to be supported financially by their husband. Their entitlement to their husbands support even extended to the tax burden on their property and income--property and income their husbands were legally prohibited from touching. There were men sent to prison in the UK for tax evasion for being unable to pay the taxes owing on the property/income of their wealthier wives. One suffragette, Dr. Elizabeth Wilks even refused (as was her right under the law) to provide her husband with the necessary documentation so he could calculate the taxes, and given that he was a schoolteacher and responsible for paying for everything else, he couldn't have afforded to pay it regardless. While he was in prison, she urged other suffragettes to do what she had. He was released from prison on humanitarian grounds due to his failing health, and died a few months later. 

2) Won default mother custody of young children upon divorce or separation thanks to the tender years doctrine. Previously, the assumption was of paternal custody since the father was solely burdened with financial responsibility for their care. Of course, it was only custody that was changed, financial responsibility still fell 100% to the father to maintain the household of his minor children.

first wave: A) In the years leading up to the First World War, the suffragettes were responsible of many incidents of bombing and arson in the United Kingdom, The targets for their attacks ranged from St Paul's Cathedral and the Bank of England in London to theatres and churches in Ireland. The violence, which included several attempted assassinations, culminated in June 1914 with an explosion in Westminster Abbey.

B)There were also many suffragettes who were racists and white supremacists, for example Susan B. Anthony who said ''I will cut off this right arm of mine before I will ask for the ballot for the Negro and not for the woman.” and Carrie Chapman Catt, the Founder of the League of Women Voters who said ''White supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by women’s suffrage.” 

C)After the titanic disaster, on April 21, 1912 the New York Times reported a story from London, England, headlined “Suffragettes Deny Chivalry on the Titanic.” in which Sylvia Pankhurst, a militant suffragette said that the men of the Titanic had not really displayed exceptional gallantry as ''women first is the universal rule''.

Domestic violence: 1)2nd wave: Erin Pizzey,  who became internationally famous for having started the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world, Chiswick Women's Aid, in 1971, the organisation known today as Refuge. She has been the subject of death threats and boycotts because of her research into the claim that most domestic violence is reciprocal, and that women are equally capable of violence as men. Pizzey has said that the threats were from militant feminists. 

2)2nd wave: She wrote an article  in which she talk about male domestic violence, how feminist journalists and radical feminist editors in publishing houses controlled the flow of information to the public, and how the feminists in America, their strangle hold over the shelters and access to government and state resources was almost absolute. She talked to about how the feminists shot her dog to threaten her. 

3)2nd wave: Richard J. Gelles, along with, Murray A. Straus, and Suzanne K. Steinmetz formed the team at the Univ. of New Hampshire that first researched family violence in the early 1970s. He is today one of the nation's foremost researchers into family violence. After finding out that the rate of female-to-male family violence was almost equal to the rate of male-to-female violence all three of them received death threats. Bomb threats were phoned in to conference centers and buildings where they were scheduled to present. Suzanne received the brunt of the attacks - individuals wrote and called her university urging that she be denied tenure; calls were made and letters were written to government agencies urging that her grant funding be rescinded.

4)2nd wave: At the University of Delaware professor Suzanne Steinmetz published an article called the ""The Battered Husband Syndrome."" After culling the findings from five surveys on domestic violence, Steinmetz reached the conclusion: wives were just as likely as their husbands to kick, punch, stab, and otherwise physically aggress against their spouses. So the feminists leveled threats against Steinmetz and her children. Sponsors of her speaking engagements started to receive threatening phone calls. Finally, a bomb threat was called in to a meeting where Steinmetz was scheduled to speak.

7)The Justice Department has known now for years since the publication of Christina Hoff Sommers’s USAToday op-ed that two of Eric Holder’s speeches in 2009 contained erroneous and false information about intimate partner homicide being the leading cause of death for black women ages 15-45. They promised Glenn Kessler and the Washington Post that the false information on the DOJ websites would be corrected “in the coming days.” It has not been corrected.

8)the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, said about domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""

9)Feminist and american sociologist Dr Michael Kimmel, who runs the Stony Brook University's Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities. NOMAS, the organization that he founded and leads, claims that men are not victims of domestic violence or abuse.., and even though he's one of the most prominent feminists that talk about ''toxic masculinity'', In 2018 he was publicly accused of sexual harassment by professor Bethany coston 

10)The duluth model which is the most common batterer intervention program used in the United States. It completely neglecte male victims and female perpetrators of abuse. The program insisted that men are perpetrators who are violent because they have been socialized in a patriarchy that condones male violence, and that women are victims who are violent only in self-defense.

11)Before the VAWA(violence against women act) There was Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, it was replaced in 1984 by the VAWA, in which until now they didn't bother to include men as victims in the title. And even though the language that they used in the VAWA is gender neutral in addressing victims of domestic violence, [the domestic violence programs discriminate against male victims.

12)Feminist and University of Ottawa law professor Elizabeth Sheehy, wants to place battered women above the law. Professor Sheehy’s thesis is that battered women should have the right to kill their husbands pre-emptively — in their sleep, say, or when they least expect it — without fear of being charged with murder.

13)The Canadian federal government’s The Transition Home Survey THS “identified 627 shelters for abused women that were operating across Canada on April 16, 2014”. There was one for men and it closed due to lack of funds and support which led to his suicide

Rape and statutory rape: 1)Feminists in India oppose making rape laws gender neutral

2)Feminists in Israel are against charging women with rape because then according to them, women would be afraid to charge men with rape.

3)Influential rape researcher Mary Koss claims male victims of female rapists aren’t real rape victims in radio interview

4)Michele Elliott OBE is an author, psychologist, teacher and the founder and director of child protection charity Kidscape. Due to her work in exposing the issue of child sexual abuse committed by women, she was subject to a lot of hate and hostility from feminists

5)The feminist and journalist Barbara Ellen said in an article in the Guardian that a female teacher sleeping with a male pupil is not on a par with a male teacher sleeping with a girl pupil, and that the female teacher doesn't deserve prison.

6)Feminist Avital Ronell, a world-renowned female professor of German and Comparative Literature at New York University, was found responsible for sexually harassing a male former graduate student, Nimrod Reitman. So a group of scholars from around the world, including prominent feminists, sent a letter to N.Y.U. in defense of Professor Ronell. One of them even was disturbed cause according to her and her colleagues Mr. Reitman was using Title IX, a feminist tool, to take down a feminist.

Rights of accused men of rape in the courts of law and public opinion, and false accusations: 1)Feminist Emily Lindin, Founder of Unslut Project, said that she's not all concerned about innocent men losing their jobs over false sexual assault/harassment allegations.

2)Feminists in Canada proposed a bill that compromises an accused's rights in sexual assault cases, so now, if the defence has a record that shows the complainant is lying or misrepresenting the evidence, that record must be disclosed in advance. A lawyer is then appointed for the complainant who is granted standing to argue for suppression of the defence evidence and even though this bill compromises an accused's rights In sexual assault cases, Pamela Cross, a Canadian feminist lawyer and feminist advocate said that even though Bill C-51 is a good start, it's still not enough.

3)London Feminist Network objecting to granting anonymity to rape defendants

4)Campaign group Women Against Rape said they were glad the government dropped the rape charge anonymity pledge

5)Men now who are accused of rape are presumed guilty under the gender equity law known as Title IX, which addresses sexual harassment and sexual violence in campus. The burden of proof, say several lawyers representing students who have been found responsible for sexual assault, is too low, letting colleges rule against alleged perpetrators on very slim, sometimes conflicting evidence. Ms Judith Grossman, a feminist who said that she would have expressed unqualified support for Title IX and for the Violence Against Women Act, until the time came when her son was falsely accused of rape in campus.

6)Feminist Jon Krakauer said that we shouldn't weaken Title IX campus sex assault policies, even though it ignored due process, abused and discriminated against many men by expelling them and destroying their future when they were actually falsely accused.

Sexism and double standard in the justice system: 1)Feminist and associate professor at the Jane Addams College of Social Work at University of Illinois at Chicago, Patricia O'Brien said that we should stop putting women in jail, for anything.

2)Feminist and Judicial College chief Lady Justice Dame Anne Rafferty, said that courts should be slow to send women to prison because jail terms are more damaging to them than men and the new guidance for judges and magistrates says real equality means favouring women and minorities to make up for the disadvantage they suffer.

3)Feminist and member of the Labour Party from the House of Lords Baroness Corston wanted to close U.K. Women’s prisons or to convert them into jails for men.

4)Women's justice taskforce says that women's prison should close

5)Judges have been told to deal less severely with female criminals than men when determining how to sentence them. And that thanks to Dame Laura Cox, a high court judge who led the team writing the rules, and the Supreme Court judge Baroness Hale who said: ""It is now well recognised that a misplaced conception of equality has resulted in some very unequal treatment for women and girls.""

6)In an HuffPost article, feminist Deborah Coles wants to end female imprisonment because she thinks that prisons are evidently ill-equipped to respond to the complex needs of women

7)Feminist and journalist Lydia Smith wrote an article in which she says It is equality to treat female offenders differently to men and by differently, she means more leniently

8)An other feminist wrote an article titled 'How can we mitigate the crime that is female over-imprisonment?' in which he's justifying why female criminals should have lighyer sentences than men. and another article in which he says that we should close women's prisons

9)A feminist wrote an article in buzzfeednews complaining how women are imprisoned for false rape claims In the UK

10)An all-female task force wants to cut Illinois’ female prison population in half because they think that 'Prison is not where women need to be' and that many of them are mothers so they shouldn't be in prison

11)In Brooklyn, the Women’s Prison Association and the attorney Charles Hynes decided to launch a program allowing female felons to serve sentences at home.

education and economics: 1)The Swedish government said to be the first feminist government in the world that it would abolish affirmative action at universities since the practice has resulted in male students being given admissions priority for several popular programmes. Hypocrites has no problem helping women when they are disadvantaged, but will quickly cut any help to men when they are the ones who are disadvantaged.

2)The same thig happened in Norway, where the Ministry of Education has concluded, after advice from the Ministry of Children and Equality, that the current equality law is not gender neutral and does not allow for men to benefit from the same forms of affirmative actions as women.

3)After the financial crisis of 2008, feminist groups skewed the Obama stimulus plan towards women's jobs even though the recession was considered a downturn for women but a catastrophe for men

Male genital mutilation: 1)Female Feminist Danish Health Minister, Ellen Trane Nørby says that Denmark will continue to circumcisie Danish boys. Previously she was ""Minister for Children, Education & Equality"". Male Genital Mutilation continues, with the direct collaboration of Feminists.

Reproductive rights and forced fatherhood: 1)Feminist Cristy Clark, a legal academic and chair of the Feminist Writers Festival, said that we shouldn't accept financial abortion and give men reproductive rights and a choice to decide to be a parent like it is for women, cause according to her if we accept financial abortion for men, we would be punishing women for not having an abortion when a man wanted them to, and that reeks of the kind of coercive control that has no place in the feminist movement.

2)Feminist and New York Times best selling author Gabrielle Blair has put the whole blame of unwanted pregnancies on men and propose either castration as a punishment or get men to be required by law to get a vasectomy as prevention

3)An article in Jezebel trivializing forced fatherhood, saying that what's only required from fathers is to pay money and that forced fatherhood is not as unfair as forced motherhood, forgetting that women at least have the chance to abort and to opt out of parenthood

4)another feminist against financial abortion said in an article in SALON that there's no such thing as forced fatherhood, and that men nowadays don't have less reproductive autonomy than women

Toxic masculinity: 1)Feminist professor at Occidental College Lisa Wade rejects the notion of ""toxic masculinity,"" saying it is time to recognize that ""it is masculinity itself that has become the problem and argue that men must renounce their masculinity and denounce anyone who chooses to identify with it. 2)Feminist Jenna Price one of the co-founders of the feminist action group, Destroy the Joint , said in an article that she wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald that all masculinity is toxic and not just parts of it, and that men need to be chaperoned.

3) Feminist professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada, Erin Dej published a book where she Slams ''Hegemonic Masculinity'' of Homeless Men. This feminist was awarded at least $185,000 by the Canadian government to research homelessness since 2009 (which could have been instead invested to actually help homeless men by giving them food or building more shelters), interviewed 27 homeless men and spent and additional 296 hours **spying** on them in homeless shelters. Instead of looking for ways to help these vulnerable men to have a better life, a house or a career, she explains that the goal of her research was to assess the ways hypermasculinity is performed among men experiencing homelessness.

Sexism, misandry and other examples of some feminists being absolute cunts: 1)Convicted felon Donna Hylton, who once was a member of a group that kidnapped, raped and tortured an elderly man to the point of death, was a featured speaker at Saturday's pro-abortion and anti-Trump Women's March on Washington

2)A campaign started by the Labour MP Stella Creasy to consider misogyny as a form of hate crime has resulted in the Law Commission deciding to consider whether misandry should be categorised as a hate crime, too. So feminist, founder of VictimFocus, researcher and speaker in the psychology of sexual violence Jessica Eaton wrote an article in the Guardian saying that misandry shouldn't be a hate crime like misogyny, cause it will embolden abusive men; another feminist named Victoria Smith also wrote an article in the independent UK complaining that misandry shouldn't be a hate crime like misogyny and saying that even considering making misandry a hate crime should concern everyone who believes in equality

3)A feminist aborts her baby because It's a boy and Is surprised by backlash

4)Militant feminist, writer, journalist and novelist Julie Burchill who contributed to newspapers such as The Sunday Times and The Guardian, and whose 2004 novel Sugar Rush was adapted for television, said that it's quite nice that men succeed in suicide more often than girls because finally they found something that they're better at than girls, and that prostitutes should be shot as collaborators for their terrible betrayal of all women

5)Feminist Julie bindel who is a regular columnist for the Guardian newspaper, having written hundreds of article for the publication, who's also a patron for charities such as “For our daughters”, the founder of Justice for Women and a research fellow at Lincoln University, in an interview with the “Rad-fem Collective” website, she proposed that all men should be put in some sort of concentration camps until they behave and that she hopes heterosexuality doesn't survive because according to her, under ''patriarchy'' heterosexuality is shit. She also wrote an article in the Guardian, titled Obama’s right, women are superior to men. Let me count the ways … in which she said that women are superior than men because they are better than them in a lot of fields. 6) For the past year three scholars rewrote Mein Kampf to use intersectional language and submitted it to a feminist journal. It was accepted and published.",1669809632.0
I’m writing a book about the extinction of men. Is this something you’d read? More info in the comments.,8,z9ftn5,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z9ftn5/im_writing_a_book_about_the_extinction_of_men_is/,13,"Hey guys.

I’ve never written a book before but always enjoyed writing. I’ve been reading a lot of books lately and most recently finished Cormac McCarthys The Road. A combination of that, browsing Reddit, and a skim of twoX lead me to ask the question: what if we did kill all men?

The book is basically about the extinction of human society. The quick decay that occurs when half the population dies due to a virus that emerges that has much more serious health effect on men than woman. Virtually every man in the country is sick and dying. What’s the fallout of that?

The protagonist is a young woman who gets pregnant just before the outbreak. The story follows her as she tries to survive in the world without men. Although so far I’ve left out any overt political messaging about feminism or any other politics for that matter, the story is the reality of the feminist fantasy of a world without men. It’s not pretty. 

I have a couple dozen pages written now as well as over 100 bullet points of story beats I want to hit along the way. My question to you guys is would this something you’d be interested in reading? If so let me know. Any feedback on the plot/story or suggestions are also welcome if you’re interested.",1669873380.0

I told him “you know that she is capable of paying for her meal, and that you shouldn’t always do it?“ he replied “she is a women and i love her very much, so i always want to treat her in the nicest way“ 
After i thought that there is gender equality in all aspects, and that women are even being treated special just because they are women. So next day i stopped donating money to that feminist organization and i stopped considering myself a feminist. That day i understood that instead of being a feminist women should raise their son’s as gentlemens who love and respect women, instead of trying to raise them as feminists.

&#x200B;

So this sub has at least realized half of the truth.

Women are privileged in Western society over men. 

So you think this is an injustice, and that we should treat everyone the same, and then society would be fair.

Again. You are still deeply deluded if you think this would work out in the long run.

Men and women are not the same.

Men and women have very differenent reproductive strategies.

A top % man can easily have 100s or even 1000s of children, while even the most succesful woman can maybe have 5-10 children at best.

Furthermore, the difference between an average man and a top man, from a reproductive point of view, is much bigger than the difference between an average woman and a top women.

Average men are often incels, they don't reproduce at all (especially historically) while average women still reproduce.

And this difference creates a big difference in the reproductive strategies between men and women.

For men it always makes sense to take a high risk approach, because getting to the top is very valuable.

For women it never makes sense to take a high risk approach, because the difference between a top and an average woman is quite low.

That's why you don't see many women going into very demanding careers. It simply doesn't make sense for them.

This stupid idea that women should have a career and not have many kids, also leads to a dysgenic implosion of society: the most high IQ women don't have kids. 

Basically, feminism leads to a genocide of intelligent women. They don't have kids.

So we are getting more stupid with each generation.

We will also see a big rise in right wing extremism. Because traditional right-wing women are the other big group who still have many kids (they didn't buy into the egalitarian lie)

I don't think there is anything to stop this process.

This society will collapse (there are many more reasons, I only gave a few of them here). And after that, we will probably go back to more traditional gender roles. Because that is the only system that works and is time tested.",1669906435.0

So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not ""real feminists"".


That's not just ""no true Scotsman"". That's delusional self deception.


Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.


But I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""


You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.


You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.


You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.


You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.


You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.


You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.


You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.


You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""


You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.


And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.

Most people, who are in commited longterm relationships are not hardcore feminists. Feminism makes people uncompatible and angry, resentful even. 

What they mean is, you're not a stud, who didn't f*ck at least 30 women. But is that really the metric they want to use? They know, they are insulting your masculinty with this, but what they are also saying is, that men only have value if they can f*ck a f*ckload (pun intended) of women, degrading the value of women for men to mere sex-objects. 

So, they are furthering a believe in society, that they are also activly fighting against. Pointing this out, even if it needs a bit of brainpower to get across properly, is like the ultimate punch to every argument.

•	⁠There is a almost equal 51/100 cheaters that are men vs 49 women.
•	⁠3/10 boys will not complete highschool, only <1/10 girls don't graduate highschool.

•	⁠8/10 bankruptcies are men initiated.
•	⁠9.9/10 inmates placed in prison due to lack of payment of child support are male.

And, when adolescent boys misbehave, they are treated as criminals, when adolescent girls misbehave, they are called rebels.

When boys are bullied, schools tell them to deal with it, when girls are bullied, the attacker is disciplined.

When boys cry, they are told not to, even mocked; when girls cry, they are given a shoulder to cry on.

When a woman falls below the poverty line, she is given support, there are refuges, food banks, and support groups.

When a man falls below the poverty line, he is blamed for his own fall. Given no support, and authorities will seek ways to get him into prison to get him off the streets.

A girl is expected to have options, a boy is expected to accept rejection as a part of life.

I have seen that the majority of those are desperate men, pathetic simp crawling creatures who are trying hard to have sex and become feminists just to get some nudes from them (I met feminist men and they usually are far more sexist than others, as they view them as sexual toys). They make me feel a lot more angry than feminist women because just for these people' fault some feminists use sex as a weapon, and they are just contributing with such awful group for such creepy deed. Apart from the fact that at least feminist women fight for themselves to be superior than men, whereas feminist men fight against themselves.

Also, the vast majority of these men are the most intolerant feminists I have ever seen. If you say anything that doesnt fit 100% with what feminists say, they will even try to physically attack you, preferably in front of them, as its their pathetic way of impressing them.

Why I'll Never Be Treating A Woman As My Equal,266,z51327,antifeminists,https://www.reddit.com/r/antifeminists/comments/z51327/why_ill_never_be_treating_a_woman_as_my_equal/,208,"Yes, you read it right. Why? Because you have more rights and privileges than I do.

Feminist women complain about being wanted to be treated as an equal to men all the time, but are you ready to carry as much responsibility a man does?


You complain about wanting to erase sexism, yet you never talk about the issues men face.

You complain about the wanting to be treated as an equal in society, but as soon as someone hits back a woman you yell, ""You can't hit a lady.""

You call yourself a ""Strong, Independent Woman"", yet it is always the man who has to pay you alimony & child support while you go around and sleep with random men.

You complain about having lesser opportunities than a man has, yet still you have gender quotas, diversity hiring, sympathy hiring, special work privileges, protection specifically for you in workplaces, gender-specific scholarships & start-up funds specifically allotted for women.

You claim that your voice is not heard, but god prohibit you from filing a false rape case. Because as soon as you file one, society will strip a man down to nothing without even an evidence provided.

You complain about having no rights, yet you have more rights than a man.

You claim to be equally capable like a man, but as soon as a war arises or the titanic starts shrinking, you want to be saved first.

You have special standards set to choose your man, but as soon as a man has standards for his woman, he's a ""misogynist"" or an ""incel"". You can say that you want someone with a six-pack, but we have to lie that we choose a woman solely by her personality, else we will be seen as judgemental.

You want a traditional man who will protect you at times of danger, yet you are not a traditional woman yourself.

You claim abortion to be a woman's right, and that it's your choice to be a mother. But the man has absolutely no choice if he wants to be a father or not, because if the woman wants to keep the baby, he is forced to pay her child support and if the woman aborts, he is not. The man has to pay for your choices, there is no choice for him.

When a woman gets abused, it's considered domestic violence. But when a man gets abused, it's fucking sitcom comedy material.

You win almost all child custody cases, serve lesser sentences than a man does for the same crime committed, win divorce cases and have almost every law favor you just because of your gender.

And yet, you still have the audacity to call yourself an ""equal"". If you really wanted equality, you'd start by erasing off all the privileges you have. But no, you want all those privileges and equality at times when it benefits you.

This is why I advice men to never treat a woman who calls herself an ""equal"" as an equal, because if she really wants to be an equal, she can start off by taking responsibilites and erasing off her privileges. Not treating someone as an equal doesn't mean you hate them, you can love a baby but still know that's it's not your equal.



P.S. This post was made towards feminist women incase I had to clear that up, since many seem to think that this post was directed towards all women.",1669446826.0

This is the first example for this thing I have seen happen in India, first hand. Just notice the number of times the word ""allegedly"" is said in the article. Meanwhile, if you were to take a similar article of a **woman** getting raped, you will find that the article has already concluded her ""allegations"" are true. And not once is the word ""rape"" used, though the guy clearly said ""the girls raped me"". Instead they use ""sexual abuse"".

And his own goddamn wife told him to not file a complaint and police refuse to take any action until that's been done. Man, I am DONE!",1669299672.0
