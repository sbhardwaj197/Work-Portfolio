# The Wage Gap in America: Occupation Feminization and Its Effect on Median Wages

This project investigates the persistent gender wage gap in the U.S., with a specific focus on whether an occupation‚Äôs gender composition influences its median wages. The work was completed as the final project for the graduate-level course **PPHA 30538: Data and Programming for Public Policy II** at the University of Chicago.

## Project Overview

Despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act over 50 years ago, the gender pay gap remains. Our work explores one key driver: **the devaluation of occupations as they become female-dominated**. We use census microdata to examine the relationship between the proportion of females in an occupation and that occupation‚Äôs median wage.

The project also includes:
- **Reddit-based sentiment analysis** of discussions on gender rights
- **Interactive data visualizations** showing wage trends by metro area and age bracket

---

## Key Questions

- Does an occupation‚Äôs feminization correlate with lower wages?
- How does the wage gap vary by age and geography across U.S. metro areas?
- What does online discourse say about gender and work?

---

## Project Components

### Regression Analysis (1950‚Äì1990, IPUMS Data)
- Constructed **hourly wages** using income, hours, and weeks worked
- Grouped by **occupation-industry-year** to define unit of analysis
- Created categorical variable for occupation gender composition (male, female, mixed)
- Applied **OLS and Fixed Effects models** to study the relationship between gender ratio and log median wages

###  Interactive Visualizations (2000‚Äì2019, Pew Data)
- Used Pew MSA-level data on **median earnings by gender and age group**
- Created **Shiny app** with:
  - A choropleth mapping women's earnings as % of men‚Äôs across metros
  - Interactive comparison of **median earnings** by gender, age, and year

### 3. Reddit Text & Sentiment Analysis
- Scraped posts from **r/MensRights** and **r/antifeminists** using `PRAW`
- Used **SpaCy** and **NLTK** to calculate sentiment polarity
- Plotted sentiment scores vs. post engagement (likes, comments)


---

##  Summary of Findings

- **Occupation Feminization** is negatively correlated with median wages (statistically significant).
- **Interactive maps** show modest improvements in wage parity from 2000 to 2019‚Äîbut a persistent gap remains, especially in older age groups.
- **Reddit analysis** reveals largely neutral to negative sentiment around gender-related topics, with high engagement on negative posts.

## Sample Regression Result (OLS)

| Variable        | Coefficient | p-value  |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Female Ratio   | -0.7251     | < 0.001  |
| Year           | +0.0118     | < 0.001  |

> A 1-unit increase in female ratio is associated with a **47% decrease in log median wage**, controlling for year and other variables.

##  Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `geopandas`, `shapely` for mapping
- `spacy`, `nltk`, `PRAW` for NLP and Reddit scraping
- `Shiny for Python` for interactive plotting

---

## Future Directions

- Update with newer occupation classifications post-2000
- Model other variables: occupational segregation, job access barriers, employer bias
- Expand text analysis with multimodal data (e.g., image memes, video content)
- Add interactive filtering by race, education, or region
