# Graduate Coursework Portfolio

This repository showcases select projects from my graduate-level coursework in python programming for public policy. It reflects my technical foundation in Python, data visualization, spatial analysis, and applied data storytelling.

## Repository Contents

### `Final Project Python/`
A comprehensive final project integrating data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to explore the effects if occupation feminization on wages in census data 
 *A detailed README is included within this folder.*

### `spatial-plotting-cta/`
A spatial analysis project that overlays **CTA train lines** with **Chicago public health data** to explore spatial disparities and transit access.  
Key skills:
- Geopandas and Matplotlib for spatial plotting  
- GeoJSON and shapefiles handling  
- Exploratory public health analysis with geographic context

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python for data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy)
- Geospatial analysis (GeoPandas, Shapely, Matplotlib)
- Data visualization and mapping
- Policy-relevant storytelling through data

## Context

These projects were completed as part of my Master's in Public Policy at the University of Chicago, where I focused on data-driven problem-solving for public systems.

> All datasets used in this repository are either publicly available or anonymized for educational purposes.

## About Me

I'm **Saloni Bhardwaj**, a Data Strategist with a background in computer science and public policy. I build data systems that drive strategic decision-making in education and public service.

Thanks for exploring!
