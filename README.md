# Graduate Coursework Portfolio

This repository showcases select projects from my graduate-level coursework in python programming for public policy. It reflects my technical foundation in Python, data visualization, spatial analysis, and applied data storytelling.

## Repository Contents

### `Final Project Python`
This final group project analyzes whether the proportion of women in an occupation influences its median wage using U.S. Census panel data. The project also includes:

- A regression analysis using IPUMS microdata (1950–1990)
- A Shiny app visualizing wage disparities across U.S. metropolitan areas using Pew Research data (2000–2019)
- Sentiment analysis of Reddit forums discussing gender and labor to explore public narratives around women's work

Tools and techniques:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels)
- Shiny for Python
- IPUMS Census data and Pew datasets
- Natural Language Processing (SpaCy, NLTK, PRAW)
- Fixed effects regression, data reshaping, and long-format analysis
- Visualization of trends across geographic and demographic segments

 *A detailed README is included within this folder.*

### `spatial-plotting-cta`
This mini-project explores spatial relationships between transit infrastructure and public health indicators in Chicago. Using shapefiles for community areas and CTA train lines from the City of Chicago Data Portal, the project creates an interactive choropleth map that allows users to:

- Toggle transit overlays
- Switch between multiple public health datasets
- Interpret geographic variation in outcomes

Tools and techniques:
- Python (GeoPandas, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Shiny for Python
- Spatial joins and mapping with shapefiles
- Data cleaning and aggregation from open civic data

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python for data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy)
- Geospatial analysis (GeoPandas, Shapely, Matplotlib)
- Data visualization and mapping
- Policy-relevant storytelling through data


# Context

These projects were completed as part of my Master's in Public Policy at the University of Chicago, where I focused on data-driven problem-solving for public systems.

## About Me

I'm **Saloni Bhardwaj**, a Data Strategist with a background in computer science and public policy. I build data systems that drive strategic decision-making in education and public service.

Thanks for exploring!
